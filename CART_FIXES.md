## Testing the Real-time Fixes

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. **Visit `/debug-cart`** to test cart operations interactively
2. **Add items to cart** from product pages and verify:
   - Loading spinner appears
   - Success feedback shows
   - **Cart count updates IMMEDIATELY in header**
   - **Cart count updates IMMEDIATELY in debug display**
3. **Visit cart page** and verify:
   - Items display correctly
   - Quantity updates work
   - Remove items works
   - Clear cart works
4. **Refresh page** to test localStorage persistence
5. **Test real-time updates**:
   - Add items from product grid
   - Check header count updates instantly
   - Add items from product detail page
   - Verify count updates across all components
6. **Test edge cases**:
   - Add same product multiple times
   - Try to add out-of-stock products
   - Test with invalid data

### API Testing:
- **GET `/api/test-cart`** - Returns test information and instructions

### Real-time Testing:
- **Watch the floating cart count display** in `/debug-cart`
- **Verify header cart count updates immediately** when adding items
- **Check that all components stay synchronized**
