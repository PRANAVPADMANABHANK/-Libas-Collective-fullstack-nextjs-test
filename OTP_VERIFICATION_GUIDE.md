# 🔐 OTP Verification System - Complete Guide

## 🎯 **What We've Implemented**

A complete OTP (One-Time Password) verification system for user registration that:

- ✅ **Sends OTP** to user's email before account creation
- ✅ **Verifies OTP** to ensure email ownership
- ✅ **Creates account** only after successful verification
- ✅ **Sends welcome email** after account creation
- ✅ **Improves security** and email deliverability

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **Step 1: User Fills Registration Form**
1. User enters name, email, password, and confirms password
2. Form validates all fields
3. User clicks "Send OTP" button

### **Step 2: OTP Email Sent**
1. System generates 6-digit OTP
2. OTP stored in memory with 10-minute expiration
3. Professional email sent via Resend with OTP
4. User receives email with verification code

### **Step 3: User Verifies OTP**
1. User enters 6-digit OTP from email
2. System verifies OTP against stored value
3. If valid: OTP marked as verified
4. If invalid: User can retry (max 3 attempts)

### **Step 4: Account Creation**
1. Only after OTP verification, user can create account
2. Firebase account created with email/password
3. User profile updated with display name
4. Welcome email sent automatically

## 📁 **New Files Created**

### **1. `/app/api/send-otp/route.ts`**
- Generates 6-digit OTP
- Stores OTP in memory with expiration
- Sends professional OTP email via Resend
- Handles errors gracefully

### **2. `/app/api/verify-otp/route.ts`**
- Verifies OTP against stored value
- Checks expiration (10 minutes)
- Limits attempts (max 3)
- Returns verification status

### **3. Updated `/components/auth/register-form.tsx`**
- Multi-step registration flow
- OTP input and verification
- Resend OTP functionality
- Form validation at each step

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **OTP Storage (In-Memory)**
```typescript
// Global OTP store (resets on server restart)
if (!global.otpStore) {
  global.otpStore = new Map()
}

// Store OTP with metadata
global.otpStore.set(email, {
  otp: "123456",
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  attempts: 0
})
```

### **OTP Expiration**
```typescript
// 10-minute expiration
const maxAge = 10 * 60 * 1000 // 10 minutes
if (otpAge > maxAge) {
  // OTP expired
}
```

### **Attempt Limiting**
```typescript
// Max 3 attempts
if (otpData.attempts >= 3) {
  // Too many attempts
}
```

## 📧 **Email Templates**
